# ADHydro_v1.0
This is release 1.0 of the ADHydro simulation

Documentation of this release is limited.  This was somewhat of a prototype
version that we immediately planned to replace with version 2.0, which will be
released very soon, so we didn't place as much emphasis on fully documenting
this release.  Please contact Robert Steinke at rsteinke@uwyo.edu if you want
to use this code and need help.
