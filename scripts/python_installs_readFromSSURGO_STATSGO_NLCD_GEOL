you may have to remove an old numpy egg from a previous version.  On our system we do this:
mv /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/numpy-1.4.1-py2.6.egg-info /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/numpy-1.4.1-py2.6.egg-info.bak
exit out of being root
delete tarball
delete numpy directory

To use qgis outside of qgis console
$export PYTHONPATH=/opt/share/qgis/python:$PYTHONPATH
then in python script
from qgis.core import *

in __main__ or somewhere at the beginning of the script put
    #Qgis setup
    qgishome = '/opt'
    app = QgsApplication([], True)
    QgsApplication.setPrefixPath(qgishome, True)
    QgsApplication.initQgis()

This ^^^ sets up data providers and such correctly

Then at the end of the script/main put
    QgsApplication.exitQgis()
